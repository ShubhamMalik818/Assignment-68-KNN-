    "Q9. What is the difference between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance in KNN?\n",

    "Euclidean distance is the most common distance metric used in KNN. It is defined as the length of the line segment connecting two points. \n",
    "Mathematically, it is the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the corresponding coordinates of the two points.\n",

    "Q10. What is the role of feature scaling in KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- Feature scaling is the process of normalizing the features in a data set so that they have a similar scale. This is important for KNN because \n",
    "     it helps to ensure that the distance metric is not biased towards features with larger scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if one feature is in the range [0, 100] and another feature is in the range [0, 1], then the Euclidean distance between two points will \n",
    "be heavily influenced by the value of the first feature. This is because the first feature has a much larger scale than the second feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling can be done using a variety of methods, such as min-max scaling and standardization. Min-max scaling normalizes the features so that \n",
    "they have a range of [0, 1]. Standardization normalizes the features so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best feature scaling method to use will depend on the specific data set and the task that is being performed. In general, min-max scaling is a \n",
    "good choice for classification tasks, while standardization is a good choice for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the benefits of feature scaling in KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improves the accuracy of the model: Feature scaling can help to improve the accuracy of the model by making the distance metric more consistent.\n",
    "2. Reduces the variance of the model: Feature scaling can help to reduce the variance of the model by making the features more comparable.\n",
    "3. Makes the model more robust to outliers: Feature scaling can help to make the model more robust to outliers by reducing the impact of outliers on \n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some of the challenges of feature scaling in KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can be time-consuming: Feature scaling can be time-consuming, especially for large data sets.\n",
    "2. Can be difficult to choose the right method: There are a number of different feature scaling methods, and it can be difficult to choose the \n",
    "                                                right method for a particular data set.\n",
